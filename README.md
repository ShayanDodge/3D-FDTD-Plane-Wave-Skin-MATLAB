# Plane Wave Propagation in a Skin (3D Finite Difference Time Domain Methods)
* This repository provides a MATLAB implementation of the 3D Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method for simulating the propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in a skin-like medium. The FDTD method is a powerful numerical technique for solving Maxwell's equations in the time domain, widely used for studying electromagnetic wave interactions with biological tissues.

## Features
* 3D FDTD Simulation: Implements a full three-dimensional FDTD algorithm to model plane wave propagation in a skin-like medium.
* Skin Medium Modeling: Accurately represents the electromagnetic properties of skin, including conductivity, permittivity, and permeability.
* User-Friendly MATLAB Code: Provides clear, well-documented MATLAB scripts that are easy to understand and modify.
* Visualization Tools: Includes functions to visualize electric and magnetic field distributions over time, allowing for detailed analysis of wave behavior in the skin medium.
* Customizable Parameters: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters such as grid size, time steps, and source properties.
